= By Whatever

Rails AR plugin that generates sexy named scopes for models

I often need to add such named scopes as by_user_id or by_account_id and they 
always looks the same

  named_scope :by_account_id, lambda { |account_id|
    (account_id.blank?) ? {} : { :conditions => ['account_id = ?', account_id.to_i] }
  }

AND

  named_scope :by_account_ids, lambda { |account_ids|
    (account_id.blank?) ? {} : { :conditions => ['account_id IN ( ? )', account_ids] }
  }


So, By Whatever  simply adds scopes for all foreight keys from model, and you 
don't have to write them all the time.

== Usage

Simplest way to get all needed scopes

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    ...
    by_whatever 
    ...
  end

Implicit inclusion and exclusion:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    ...
    by_whatever :only => [:user_id, :account_id]
    ...
  end

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    ...
    by_whatever :except => [:user_id, :account_id]
    ...
  end
